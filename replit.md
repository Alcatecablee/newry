# NeuroLint - Advanced Code Analysis Platform

## Overview

NeuroLint is a comprehensive code analysis and transformation platform built with React, TypeScript, and Node.js. The application provides advanced code linting, transformation, and modernization capabilities with team collaboration features. Currently in beta with smart architecture ready for future AI integration.

## Project Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

  - **Result**: All 6 layers now pass validation successfully with 100% success rate
  - **CLI Implementation**: Full-featured command-line tool with analysis, fixing, and interactive modes
  - **VS Code Extension**: Real-time diagnostics, code actions, and integrated transformation capabilities
  - **API Endpoints**: Added CLI-specific routes for seamless integration
  - **Enhanced Landing Page**: Added sections for CLI, VS Code extension, REST API, and integrations

- **2024-01-20**: Successfully migrated from Lovable to Replit
  - Replaced Supabase with PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
  - Moved client-side database calls to secure server API routes
  - Integrated Clerk authentication with environment variables
  - Added PayPal payment processing via server routes
  - Removed all external dependencies (Supabase)
  - Established secure API key management
  - Fixed client-side Node.js compatibility issues
  - Resolved browser runtime errors by removing Node.js imports
  - Added browser polyfills for Node.js globals
  - Implemented proper layer orchestration patterns with dependency management
  - Added AST/regex fallback strategy for layers 3-4
  - Enhanced transformation validation with reduced false positives
  - Application fully operational with robust layer system

## Key Features

- Multi-layer code analysis and transformation (6 layers total, all active and passing)
- Layer-specific validation strategies (lenient for layers 3-4, strict for layers 5-6)
- AST/regex fallback transformation strategy
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for automated workflows and CI/CD integration
- **VS Code Extension**: Real-time analysis, diagnostics, and fixes directly in the editor
- Real-time collaboration tools
- User authentication and billing
- Team dashboard and analytics
- Enterprise features (SSO, webhooks, compliance)
- Responsive design with mobile support

## User Preferences

- **Design Style**: Clean, professional monochrome design (black, white, gray only)
- **No colorful elements**: Specifically requested removal of purple colors and any bright/colorful UI elements
- **Interface Focus**: Prioritize functionality and readability over visual flair

## Technical Decisions

- Used Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions
- Implemented server-side API routes for security
- Maintained client/server separation for scalability
- Used environment variables for secure secret management
